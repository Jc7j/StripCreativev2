              During this discovery phase, our team starts a thorough research
              and analysis to understand your project in detail. We employ
              numerous research methods to uncover valuable insights about your
              competitors and target audience. This process allows us to gather
              data that informs our design and d evelopment decisions, ensuring
              our methods and solutions are aligned with your business
              objectives.

              Having understood your requirements we embark on a creative
              journey to develop design ideas. We utilize collaborative
              brainstorming and prototyping, which in return breathes life into
              the concepts and we further refine them with valuable user
              feedback. This iterative process ensures that our final designs
              are user-centered and all options have been explored to deliver
              cutting-edge solutions that engage and convert.

              Our talented developers focus on translating the designs into
              working versions on our staging servers. By collaborating closely,
              our designers and developers facilitate a smooth handover for
              integration of the designs into the development process. Our goal
              is to craft designs that not only look visually great but are also
              practical and ready for integration, ensuring a smooth transition
              from design to development.

            <p>
              With a meticulous approach, we ensure that the website works and
              looks great across all platforms, by physically testing on all
              screen resolutions, cross-browser, including mobile and tablet
              devices. This is a very intricate process where we meticulously
              fine-tune the final product. Our goal is to create websites that
              are functional and user friendly to increase customer conversion
              and retention.

              When you have fully tested and approved the final version of the
              website on our staging server, we begin the migration process of
              deploying the website onto your live server. We run our final
              check list to make sure everything runs smoothly before we finally
              push the “go live” button. We also provide aftercare website
              support if required.
