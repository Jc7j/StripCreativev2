              feedback. This iterative process ensures that our final designs

              Our talented developers focus on translating the designs into
              working versions on our staging servers. Our goal is to craft
              designs that not only look visually great but are also practical
              and ready for integration, ensuring a smooth transition from
              design to development. With a meticulous approach, we ensure that
              the website works and looks great across all platforms, by
              physically testing on all screen resolutions, cross-browser,
              including mobile devices. Our goal is to create websites that are
              functional and user friendly to increase customer conversion and
              retention.

              When you have fully tested and approved the final version of the
              website on our staging server, we begin the migration process of
              deploying the website onto your live server. We run our final
              check list to make sure everything runs smoothly before we finally
              push the “go live” button. We also provide aftercare website
              support if required.
