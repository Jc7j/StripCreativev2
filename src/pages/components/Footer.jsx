    q: "What's the Strip Creative delivery process?",
    a: "The Strip Creative process is straightforward. It starts with a kickoff call to understand your goals and inspiration. After that, you provide feedback while we take care of the rest, keeping you updated every 1-2 days via Slack or video. Providing fast website performance, industry level SEO and scalability is like our second nature. We're here to help you get your website out the door as fast as possible with the help of our team.",

  {
    q: "What's the main difference between Membership and Project-Based?",
    a: "Both offer the same benefits. Project based is great if you need a high quality landing or marketing page fast and thats all. While membership, we'll also deliver a high quality website fast, but you need ongoing support, improvements or new additions consistently to figure out what works best.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why would't I just hire a full-time designer or developer?",

We partner with you for as long as you need us and every signle dollar you spend with us is dedicated to active work. ",
  },

    q: "Who owns the work?",

  },
  {
    q: "I have a smaller project that can't afford to pay for a full membership?",

  {
    q: "What if I dont like my designs?",

  },
  {
    q: "Can i pause or cancel my membership?",
    a: "Yes! You can pause or cancel your membership anytime. We wouldnt want you to pay for our services when you're not using it. You'll find access to handle your billing in the notion board we provide to you!",
